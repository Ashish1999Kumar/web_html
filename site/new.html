		<div >
			Death is nothing at all.<br />
			It does not count.<br />
			I have only slipped away into the next room.<br /> 
			Nothing has happened.<br />
			<br />Everything remains exactly as it was.<br /> 
			I am I, and you are you, <br />
			and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.<br /> 
			Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. <br />
			<br />Call me by the old familiar name. <br />
			Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br />
			Put no difference into your tone. <br />
			Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.<br /> 
			<br />Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br />
			Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. <br />
			Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.<br /> 
			Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.<br /> 
			<br />Life means all that it ever meant. <br />
			It is the same as it ever was. <br />
			There is absolute and unbroken continuity.<br /> 
			What is this death but a negligible accident? <br />
			<br />Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?<br /> 
			I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br />
			somewhere very near, <br />
			just round the corner. <br />
			<br />All is well. <br />
			Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.<br /> 
			One brief moment and all will be as it was before.<br /> 
			How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!<br />

<div >
Do not stand at my grave and weep<br />
I am not there; I do not sleep.<br />
I am a thousand winds that blow,<br />
I am the diamond glints on snow,<br />
I am the sun on ripened grain,<br />
I am the gentle autumn rain.<br />
When you awaken in the morning's hush<br />
I am the swift uplifting rush<br />
Of quiet birds in circled flight. <br />
I am the soft stars that shine at night.<br /> 
Do not stand at my grave and cry, <br />
I am not there; I did not die.<br />

</div>
