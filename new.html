		<div >
			Death is nothing at all.<br />
			It does not count.<br />
			I have only slipped away into the next room.<br /> 
			Nothing has happened.<br />
			<br />Everything remains exactly as it was.<br /> 
			I am I, and you are you, <br />
			and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.<br /> 
			Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. <br />
			<br />Call me by the old familiar name. <br />
			Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br />
			Put no difference into your tone. <br />
			Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.<br /> 
			<br />Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br />
			Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. <br />
			Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.<br /> 
			Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.<br /> 
			<br />Life means all that it ever meant. <br />
			It is the same as it ever was. <br />
			There is absolute and unbroken continuity.<br /> 
			What is this death but a negligible accident? <br />
			<br />Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?<br /> 
			I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br />
			somewhere very near, <br />
			just round the corner. <br />
			<br />All is well. <br />
			Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.<br /> 
			One brief moment and all will be as it was before.<br /> 
			How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!<br />

<div >
Do not stand at my grave and weep<br />
I am not there; I do not sleep.<br />
I am a thousand winds that blow,<br />
I am the diamond glints on snow,<br />
I am the sun on ripened grain,<br />
I am the gentle autumn rain.<br />
When you awaken in the morning's hush<br />
I am the swift uplifting rush<br />
Of quiet birds in circled flight. <br />
I am the soft stars that shine at night.<br /> 
Do not stand at my grave and cry, <br />
I am not there; I did not die.<br />

		<h1 style="padding:0px; color:#0000FF;text-align:left;" >Phenomenal Woman</h1>
		<div >
Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. <br />
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size <br />
But when I start to tell them, <br />
They think I'm telling lies. <br />
I say, <br />
It's in the reach of my arms <br />
The span of my hips, <br />
The stride of my step, <br />
The curl of my lips. <br />
I'm a woman <br />
Phenomenally. <br />
Phenomenal woman, <br />
That's me. <br />
<br />
I walk into a room <br />
Just as cool as you please, <br />
And to a man, <br />
The fellows stand or <br />
Fall down on their knees. <br />
Then they swarm around me, <br />
A hive of honey bees. <br />
I say, <br />
It's the fire in my eyes, <br />
And the flash of my teeth, <br />
The swing in my waist, <br />
And the joy in my feet. <br />
I'm a woman <br />
Phenomenally. <br />
Phenomenal woman, <br />
That's me. <br />
<br />
Men themselves have wondered <br />
What they see in me. <br />
They try so much <br />
But they can't touch <br />
My inner mystery. <br />
When I try to show them <br />
They say they still can't see. <br />
I say, <br />
It's in the arch of my back, <br />
The sun of my smile, <br />
The ride of my breasts, <br />
The grace of my style. <br />
I'm a woman <br />
<br />
Phenomenally. <br />
Phenomenal woman, <br />
That's me. <br />
<br />
Now you understand <br />
Just why my head's not bowed. <br />
I don't shout or jump about <br />
Or have to talk real loud. <br />
When you see me passing <br />
It ought to make you proud. <br />
I say, <br />
It's in the click of my heels, <br />
The bend of my hair, <br />
the palm of my hand, <br />
The need of my care, <br />
'Cause I'm a woman <br />
Phenomenally. <br />
Phenomenal woman, <br />
That's me<br />

		<h1 style="padding:10px; color:#0000FF;text-align:left;" >If</h1>
		<div >
If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too:<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated don't give way to hating,<br />
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;<br />
<br />
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br />
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two impostors just the same:.<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;<br />
<br />
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,<br />
And never breathe a word about your loss:<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"<br />
<br />
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much:<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br />
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!<br />
